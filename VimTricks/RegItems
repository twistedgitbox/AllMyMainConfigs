TMUX COPY


    Ctrl+b, [ Enter copy(?) mode.

    Move to start/end of text to highlight.

    Ctrlspace

    Start highlighting text (on Arch Linux). When I've compiled tmux from source on OSX and other Linux's, just Space on its own usually works. Selected text changes the colours, so you'll know if the command worked.

    Move to opposite end of text to copy.

    Alt+w Copies selected text into tmux clipboard.

    Move cursor to opposite tmux pane, or completely different tmux window. Put the cursor where you want to paste the text you just copied.

    Ctrl+b, ] Paste copied text from tmux clipboard.

tmux is quite good at mapping commands to custom keyboard shortcuts.

See Ctrl+b,? for the full list of set keyboard shortcuts.
